# Wix App Market - OAuth boilerplate for usability testing

You'll build a new `Wix app` with the help of this step-by-step guide.
 
You'll learn about Wix APIs, components, OAUTH, and other best practices.


## Prerequisites

Before you get started, let's make sure you have the following set up in your workspace:

- Sign in to Wix at [https://www.wix.com] with a non-wix email account.
- Have Node.js installed on your computer (version 16.14.0 or higher) [https://nodejs.org/en/download/].
- IDE/text editor. (For example, Visual Studio Code) [https://code.visualstudio.com/].

## ðŸš€ Your goal

Wix enables site owners to sell products, services, etc. for purchase through their site.  
Every purchase triggers the creation of a transaction within Wix.  
You are an invoice company (e.g. Blue Invoice) developer and you want to create an app that will integrate with Wix sites and will generate Blue Invoice invoices.  
Create an application that will:  
- create an invoice (including list of the purchased items, amount paid per item, total amount paid, customer name and address, site name) for every transaction made through Wix on a Wix site. 
- send the invoice to the customerâ€™s email.



## Steps:

### Step 1 - Clone the `wix-developers-example-apps` repository

1. In your Terminal emulator, run the following command from the folder that will hold your projects:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wix-incubator/wix-developers-example-apps.git
```

The repository should now be cloned to your computer.

2. Change directory to the OAuth bolierplate

```bash
cd wix-developers-example-apps/oauth-boilerplate
```

If you do not use Git, you can download zip file of this repo, under `Code` click the `Download ZIP`, similar to the following:

![Download zip](../images/download-repo-zip.jpg?raw=true)



### Step 2 - Create an app in the Wix Developers Center


-   [Go to Wix Developers Center (https://dev.wix.com)][wix-dev-center]

-   Click the `Get Started` button.

-  If this is your first app, click `Start Building`. If you already have an app, you should see and click `Create New App` instead.


### Step 3 - Create a development site to test your app 
 
-  In your app dashboard page click the `Test Your App` button. you should see the option to create a development site. A site with `Wix Stores` is what we need for now, so just click `Create Site`.


-  ![wix development site](../images/development-site.jpg?raw=true)


### Step 4 - Add a dashboard component to your app in the Wix Developers Center

1. Go to your app [Wix Developer Center][wix-dev-center]
2. Look for the `Components` page on the left sidebar and click `Add Component`, choose `Dashboard Component`. It should look like:

    ![wix development site](../images/add-component.jpg?raw=true)
3. If you already started your server you will see in the terminal the `app dashboard link:` copy it and set it to be the `Page URL` of the `Dashboard Page`
    And click `Save`, It should look like this:

    ![wix development site](../images/dashboard-new.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 5 - Start NOde.js and configure OAuth
 

1. Start the Node.js server:

-   Go to the server folder in a new terminal
   
    ```bash
    cd server 
    ```
-  Run one of the following to install js packages:
    ```bash
    yarn 
    ```
    Or
    ```bash
    npm install 
    ```
-  Under the server folder run the following command to create a `.env` file from the `example.env.text`   
    ```bash
    cp  example.env.txt .env
    ```
    Replace the `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` parameters in the `.env` file by taking them from the OAuth page of your app in the [Wix Developer Center][wix-dev-center].
    It should look like this:

    ![app secret](../images/app-id-app-secret.jpg?raw=true)
    
    We will skip the `WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEY` parameter for now.

-  After the installation ends successfuly and you have `.env` file ready with your `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` parameters it's time to start the server.
Run the following command:
    ```bash
    yarn run start 
    ```
    Or
    ```bash
    npm run start 
    ```
    In the terminal you will get something similar to the following:

    ![terminal](../images/terminal-new.jpg?raw=true)
    
    In the next step we will need the `AppUrl` and `RedirectUrl` you got in the terminal


2. Configure the [OAuth] at the [Wix Developer Center][wix-dev-center]
-   Go to your app in [Wix Developer Center][wix-dev-center]
-   Look for the `OAuth` page in the sidebar. Under the `URLs` section insert the `Redirect URL` and the `App URL` you copied from the terminal output you got in the previous step. It should look like this::
    ![wix development site](../images/oauth-appurl-redirect.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 6 - Configure your app to fulfill your use case

Here are some things you will likely need to get your app to work as expected:

**Permissions**  
The following permissions are relevant to most invoicing apps:  
Contacts & Members > Read members & contacts - all read permissions  
Wix eCommerce > Read eCommerce - all read permissions  
Wix Payments > Wix Payments - view transactions  

**Webhooks**  
The following webhooks are relevant to most invoicing apps: 

App Management: 
- App Installed
- App Removed

Wix eCommerce:
- Order Approved
- Order Updated
- Payment Status Updated
- Order Canceled

Wix Payments:
- Payment Event



### Step 7 - Install the app on the development site you created

1. Go to your app at [Wix Developer Center][wix-dev-center]  
2. Click `Test Your App` and select the `App Market` option. You'll be redirected to select the site you want to install the app on.   
3. Select any site and you'll be redirected to the app installer.   
  ![wix development site](../images/test-your-app.jpg?raw=true)
4. In the app installer you can see the app needed permission. These are the permissions a site owner sees when installing your app. Click `Add To Site`.  
  ![wix development site](../images/installer.jpg?raw=true)
5. After installation you will be redirected to the app dashboard to see the result of calling the API of app instance


#### You can browse the code and try understand it:
  - Look for the `WixOAuthFacade` and `WixAuthController` classes For OAUTH.
  - Look for the `ApiController` class to understand the call to the `\api\dashboard` URL.
  - Look for the `InstanceDecoder` to understand how we parse signInstance param which wix inject to the dashborad url in order for you to recognise the specific installation of your site.
